# Calender-App
Goal
Develop a single-page-application that allows us to schedule events.
Tools
 Twitter Bootstrap 3
 Localstorage API
 Any Javascript Library (Backbone, Angular 1 or 2, JSMVC, etc)
Summary
Your boss complained that he always forgets his schedule and he does not like Google Calendar. He came to
you asking to create him a calendar application.
He wants to see the weekly schedule only and be able to navigate between weeks.
The last feature would be to add appointments and he would be happy if he could get notifications in the
browser for the upcoming events.
Criteria
 Single page application
 The design is responsive and is usable both on desktop and mobile devices
 Use the JS framework to
o Define models
o Define modules for each application context
o Use a stateful approach to render the application
 You can use any third party libraries to solve a complex issue, but the most important thing here is to
see your code and the way you approach this issue
